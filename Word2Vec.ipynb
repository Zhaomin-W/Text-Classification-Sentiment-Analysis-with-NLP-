the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . \\nhe attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . \\nafter they ricochet off his face , he says , \" not a good start . \" \\nas it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . \\nin this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed \" condor \" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . \\nfor some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . \\ni think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . \\nwatch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . \\nthe chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . \\nit's almost a guarantee . \\nanyway . . . . \\ncondor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . \\nto help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . \\nthere aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . \\nalthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . \\nin fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . \\ni suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . \\nif you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . \\nthey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . \\nknowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . \\nyou've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . \\nalso of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . \\nas far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . \\nwhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . \\nunlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining . \\nyou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . \\nunfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film . \\nthe plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . \\ncarol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . \\nthis , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>richard linklater's \" slacker , \" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \\nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \\ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \\nask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , \" oh , you know , just hanging out . \" \\nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \\nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \\nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in \" scooby-doo . \" \\nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \\nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \\nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \\nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \\nthe only problem with \" slacker \" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \\nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \\nthere are only so many times you can hear , \" hey , what's going on ? \" \\n \" not much , what are you up to ? \" \\n \" nothing really , just hanging around , \" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \\nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . \\ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \\n \" slacker \" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \\ni just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \\n</td>\n",

\\nthe only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . \\neveryone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . \\nactually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city . \\nnot only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . \\nwith a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not . \\nhis wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name \" bunny . \" \\nnot only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project . \\nit's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first . \\nmeanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . \\nhis trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers . \\nthe above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . \\ni haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . \\nthen there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary . \\nnot to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . \\nand so on . \\nthe film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . \\nrudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . \\nthe surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . \\nthe actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . \\nwillis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . \\nwith such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . \\nunlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . \\nas such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve . \\nvonnegut's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson's _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . \\nwith the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled \" unfilmable \" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? \\nlikely not . \\n   \n",
       "64   when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n   \n",

vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly d'angelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family . \\nas with the other three films , their two children , rusty and audrey , are played by a revolving series of actors . \\nthis time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles . \\nalso back , is cousin eddie ( randy quaid ) , the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes . \\nin vegas vacation clark griswold ( chase ) decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen ( d'angelo ) can renew their wedding vows . \\nit is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue . \\napparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldn't bother to write any jokes into the script . \\nat least that's the way it looks when watching this turkey . \\nabout half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film , since there had been none up to that point . \\nby the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times , and i had smiled at a couple of gags . \\ni might add that none of the funny ( and i use the term loosely ) moments came as a result of anything chase , d'angelo or quaid were involved in . \\nthey might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film . \\nthe two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids , who manage to have a couple of their own adventures . \\nrusty becomes a vegas high roller , providing most of the film's best moments . \\nevery time chase and quaid were involved in a gag , it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film . \\nwhich brings me to the best moment of the film . \\nthe griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road ( the theme from the original vacation ) begins to play . \\nchristie brinkley and her red ferrari ( also from the first movie ) drive by . \\nit was a cute moment , but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been , and just how far that this series has fallen . \\ntoo bad . \\n   \n",

\\njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \\nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \\nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \\ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \\none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \\nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \\nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \\nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \\nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \\nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \\neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \\nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \\nit has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \\nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \\nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \\noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \\na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \\nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \\nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . \\njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \\na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \\nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \\nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \\ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n   \n",

italians , french canadians and iranians . \\nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . \\nwell , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . \\nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . \\nwe know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . \\nin the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . \\nduring the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . \\nthat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . \\nthe photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . \\n   \n",

the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . \\nto help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . \\nthere aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . \\nalthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . \\nin fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . \\ni suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . \\nif you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . \\nthey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . \\nknowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . \\nyou've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . \\nalso of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . \\nas far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . \\nwhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . \\nunlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining . \\nyou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . \\nunfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film . \\nthe plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . \\ncarol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . \\nthis , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \\n   \n",

\" \\n \" not much , what are you up to ? \" \\n \" nothing really , just hanging around , \" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \\nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . \\ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \\n \" slacker \" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \\ni just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \\n   \n",
